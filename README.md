## **Ensemble Learning Labs - ReadMe**  

### **Overview**  
This lab explores **ensemble learning techniques** to improve model performance by combining multiple models. We focus on:  
- **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)** â€“ Example: Random Forest  
- **Boosting** â€“ Example: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting  
- **Stacking** â€“ Combining different models for better predictions  

### **Key Steps in the Lab**  
1. **Baseline Models** â€“ Train and evaluate individual models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, kNN).  
2. **Bagging (Random Forest)** â€“ Train multiple decision trees on bootstrapped samples.  
3. **Boosting (AdaBoost, XGBoost)** â€“ Improve weak learners iteratively.  
4. **Stacking** â€“ Use multiple base models and a meta-model to improve predictions.  
5. **Model Evaluation** â€“ Compare models using log loss, accuracy, precision, and recall.  

### **Key Takeaways**  
- **Bagging reduces variance** and helps prevent overfitting.  
- **Boosting reduces bias** and improves weak learners.  
- **Stacking combines different models** for better generalization.  
- **Random Forest balances bias-variance tradeoff**, making it a strong ensemble method.
